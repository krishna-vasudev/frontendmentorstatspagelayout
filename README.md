## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

It was a great project of css. The most difficult part was creating the overlay of image which is responsive. So i used a trick in which i recreated the overlay over image using css which was not responsive but overlapping the whole image, took screenshot and saved it in png format and used it. Hope this trick will help others too.
